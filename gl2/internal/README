- internal/gl holds OpenGL 2.0 wrappers generated by Glow
  (http://github.com/go-gl/glow)

- internal/restrict.json is the JSON restriction file to be fed to Glow in order
  to keep the file size of the generated wrappers (and compilation times) low.

- internal/procaddr is literally a copy of github.com/go-gl/glow with import
  paths rewritten to our azul3d.org/gfx/gl2.vX/internal/procaddr import path.

- internal/gl/* must be modified to use our procaddr import path.

- Note: Internal import paths here must be rewritten for new versions as well.
