# Azul3D - gfx #
This package provides generic interfaces to GPU-based rendering techniques.

The gfx package is not useful by itself but instead part of a larger picture as the package provides generic interfaces and data types to modern graphics rendering API's such as OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL, Direct3D, etc.
